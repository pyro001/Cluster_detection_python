Segmentation algorythims to seperate the clusters 

" Implement the code so it works for hundreds of images " 

We will get some kind of curve or a barge that tells us how many clsuters or particles are in the image 
(5 clusters with 27 particles, 3 clusters with 22 particles etc..)

Optimization :
Lagrangian multiplyers is probably the best, kkt method also good 

"Am I looking at rods, triangles or sphears" 

Machine learning is not a must to do.. woop 

2.2 - we have global optimization algorithims, local optimisation, we can also combine what we want 
2.3 - write a report (write down what we do and what is the outcome, block diagrams etc, figures documenting the steps, resaults will not be images but graphs with statistics, the graph does not mean shit untill we interprid the graph, write it down as throughly as posible, plug code in apendix, One submission per team)

With optimizing we have some data that we calculate a error from useing the function that we used to get the data I think and then we try to optimize it by changeing the function to minimize the magnitude of the error. Ath excersise week 48 

We can use the libray or OpenCv if we want, basicly just do what ever to get the task done 


Exam : 
15min(aim for 12 cus shit hapens) group presentation, 15min personal presentation, "Have one group presentation, dont just scroll through the report, equaly distribute talking points, always the case of un-equal proportions to who does what but be asured that they will feel out who did what so dont make to much of a fuzz who did what" 
The personal thing can be from the entire course content but will mainly focus on the methods used in the project   


Check if lines > cyrcles and if so
